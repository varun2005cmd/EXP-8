# Experiment 8 :- To study and implement C++ 2D Array - Matrices

## AIM: -
To learn how to implement 2D arrays (Matrices) in C++ and its operations like addition, multiplcation , diagonal addition and comparing 2 rows 

## Software: - VS Code

## Theory: -

Arrays can be categorised in 2 types as follows: -
1. One dimensional array
2. Multi dimensional array

In this experiments we are going to learn about 2 dimensional arrrays also known as matrices. Matrices consist of rows and columns each consisting of 1 dimension array therfore making them 2D arrays. 

### Basic Operations on Matrices: - 

1. Taking Inputs for the matrix elements and storing them in the matrix.
2. Taking transpose of a matrix and storing it in a new matrix.
3. Addition of two matrices and storing the sum in a new matrix.
4. Subtraction of two matrices and storing the difference in a new matrix.
5. Multiplication of two matrices and storing the product in a new matrix.

### Conclusion: -

In this experimennt we learnt how to implement 2D arrays (matrices) and its operations like addition, multiplication, diagonal addition, transposing, etc in C++ programming language.
